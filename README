This program is intended to produce an ordering of claims as they would appear in an International Search Report drafted according to the Patent Cooperation Treaty.
The order of claims is determined by the references used to obviate it, and the order in which the references are introduced.

To use the orderer, enter each claim and its parent claim one by one.
Then enter the references used as per the instructions.
The program will output the claims in the appropriate order.
